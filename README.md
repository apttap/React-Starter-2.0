## React Starter 2.0 ##
An easy React Starter Kit to get you up and running quickly. It includes the some of the latest and greatest:

 - Express 4
 - React Router 4
 - Webpack 2
 - Webpack Dev Server
 - Hot Reloading
 - SCSS Support
 - **Coming Soon**: Auto-prefixer support for your SCSS and CSS styles.

## Installation ##

 1. `git clone https://github.com/DZuz14/React-Starter-2.0`
 2. `npm install`
 3. `npm run dev` for hot-reloading or `npm start` for regular use.

If you want changes to get applied to your bundle.js file when not using this under npm run dev, you need to type `npm run build` to run the webpack compiler to rebundle your assets. If you need further clarification, just open an issue on the board. I will gladly respond.
